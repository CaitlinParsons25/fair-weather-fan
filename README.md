On the starting page, the user is presented with a form where they can input a city name and press "Search."

### 2. With the user-input city, generate current weather data

The app then presents the name and current weather data (including temperature, windspeed, and humidity) for the user's chosen city.

### 3. With the user-input city, generate a 5-day weather forecast

Below the current weather data, the app presents a 5-day weather forecast (including date, low and high temperatures, and condition) for the user's chosen city.

### 4. Save a search history of the user-input cities
